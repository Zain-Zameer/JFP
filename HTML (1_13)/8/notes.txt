what is preload attribute? 
The preload attribute is used in the <audio> and <video> HTML elements to tell the browser how it should load the media file before the user plays it.

Think of it like this:
Imagine you visit a website with an audio file (like a song). The browser has three choices:

Not load it at all until you press play.
Load only basic details (like the length of the song).
Start downloading the whole file in advance (so there's no delay when you press play).
Explanation of preload values:
none → Don’t load anything until the user presses play.
metadata → Load only the audio’s information (like duration, size, etc.), but not the actual sound.
auto → Start downloading the audio in the background, so it plays instantly when the user presses play.
